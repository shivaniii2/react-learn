npm:

npm stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js and JavaScript.

npm is primarily used for installing, managing, and publishing packages (dependencies) for your Node.js projects.

It is typically used for tasks like installing packages (npm install), updating packages (npm update), removing packages (npm uninstall), and running scripts defined in your package.json file (npm run).


npx :

npx is a package runner tool that comes bundled with npm (since npm version 5.2.0).
It is used to execute Node.js packages directly from the npm registry without having to install them globally or locally.
npx allows you to run commands from packages that are not installed on your system, by fetching and executing them temporarily.
It is commonly used for running command-line tools, scripts, or one-off tasks without the need to install them globally or cluttering up your project's dependencies.

In general, npm is used for managing project dependencies and scripts, while npx is used for running command-line tools and scripts temporarily without installing them globally or locally.
