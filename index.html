When a user requests a webpage, the CDN automatically delivers the requested content from the server that is closest to the user, reducing latency and improving page load times. -->

<!-- Let us understand about that crossorigin attribute we were using earlier -->

<!-- This attribute is used for security reasons when loading scripts from a different domain. The crossorigin attribute, when set, indicates that the browser should perform a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) request when fetching the script. This is necessary if the script is hosted on a different domain than the one serving the HTML document.


CORS, which stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources from another domain. This security measure helps prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to a different domain on behalf of a user.


By default, web browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page.

When a web page hosted on one domain attempts to make a request (e.g., via AJAX, Fetch API, or XMLHttpRequest) to a resource on a different domain, the browser enforces CORS.

CORS Headers: The server hosting the resource can include special HTTP headers in its response to inform the browser whether the request is allowed. These headers include:

Access-Control-Allow-Origi Specifies which origins are permitted to access the resource. For example, if a server includes Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com, only requests from "https://example.com" will be allowed.
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Specifies the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) that are allowed when accessing the resource.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Specifies which HTTP headers can be used during the actual request.

Preflight Requests: For certain types of requests (e.g., those with custom headers or using methods other than GET or POST), the browser may send a preflight request (an HTTP OPTIONS request) to check if the server allows the actual request. The server responds with the appropriate CORS headers. -->
